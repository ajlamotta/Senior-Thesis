# Senior-Thesis
This repository contains all relevant code and CSV files for my Harvard undergraduate senior math thesis. I had assistance from Lev Kruglyak and ChatGPT.

Rust files for SK simulations will be uploaded ASAP.

Python Files:
1. bin_packing.py generates data to plot $\mathrm{Var}(B)$ in Fig 9, pg 22 (Bin Packing);
    creates csv file binpacking.csv in format: n,var_b 
2. tw_clt.py generates data to plot 3 ECDFs in Fig 11, pg 33 (Tracy-Widom CLT);
    creates csv file tw_clt.csv in format: x,ecdf_n10,ecdf_n100,ecdf_n1000
3. wigner.py generates data to plot histogram in Fig 4, pg 14 (Semicircular Law);
    creates single column csv file wigner.csv
